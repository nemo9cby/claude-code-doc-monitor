## Summary
The documentation for multishot prompting with Claude has been significantly expanded to include detailed guidance on using examples to enhance the model&#39;s output quality. This addition emphasizes the importance of structured prompts and provides practical tips for developers.

## Key Changes
- **Introduction of Multishot Prompting**: Defines the concept and its benefits for generating accurate and consistent outputs.
- **Tips for Effective Examples**: Offers specific advice on crafting relevant, diverse, and clear examples to improve Claude&#39;s performance.
- **Comparison Table**: Includes a side-by-side comparison of Claude&#39;s responses with and without examples, illustrating the impact of effective prompting.
- **Additional Resources**: Links to a prompt library and tutorials for further learning, enhancing the developer&#39;s toolkit.
- **Structured Formatting Guidance**: Introduces the use of `&lt;example&gt;` and `&lt;examples&gt;` tags for organizing prompts.

## Impact
**Medium**: The changes improve the documentation significantly, providing developers with actionable insights to enhance their interactions with Claude. This is crucial for optimizing model performance and ensuring better output quality, but it does not introduce new features or breaking changes.</div>

+# Use examples (multishot prompting) to guide Claude&#39;s behavior
+
+---
+
+&lt;Note&gt;
+While these tips apply broadly to all Claude models, you can find prompting tips specific to extended thinking models [here](/docs/en/build-with-claude/prompt-engineering/extended-thinking-tips).
+&lt;/Note&gt;
+
+Examples are your secret weapon shortcut for getting Claude to generate exactly what you need. By providing a few well-crafted examples in your prompt, you can dramatically improve the accuracy, consistency, and quality of Claude&#39;s outputs.
+This technique, known as few-shot or multishot prompting, is particularly effective for tasks that require structured outputs or adherence to specific formats.
+
+&lt;Tip&gt;**Power up your prompts**: Include 3-5 diverse, relevant examples to show Claude exactly what you want. More examples = better performance, especially for complex tasks.&lt;/Tip&gt;
+
+## Why use examples?
+
+- **Accuracy**: Examples reduce misinterpretation of instructions.
+- **Consistency**: Examples enforce uniform structure and style.
+- **Performance**: Well-chosen examples boost Claude&#39;s ability to handle complex tasks.
+
+## Crafting effective examples
+
+For maximum effectiveness, make sure that your examples are:
+- **Relevant**: Your examples mirror your actual use case.
+- **Diverse**: Your examples cover edge cases and potential challenges, and vary enough that Claude doesn&#39;t inadvertently pick up on unintended patterns.
+- **Clear**: Your examples are wrapped in `&lt;example&gt;` tags (if multiple, nested within `&lt;examples&gt;` tags) for structure.
+
+&lt;Tip&gt;Ask Claude to evaluate your examples for relevance, diversity, or clarity. Or have Claude generate more examples based on your initial set.&lt;/Tip&gt;
+&lt;section title=&#34;Example: Analyzing customer feedback&#34;&gt;

+    Notice that in the &#34;no examples&#34; version, Claude does not list multiple options for each category, despite its written analysis indicating that there are multiple categories for certain feedback. It also includes a long explanation when we may not want it to.
