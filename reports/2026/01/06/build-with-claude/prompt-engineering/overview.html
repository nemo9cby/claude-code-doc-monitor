## Summary
The documentation for prompt engineering in Claude has been significantly expanded with a comprehensive overview, detailing the importance of prompt engineering, its advantages over fine-tuning, and a structured approach to implementing it.

## Key Changes
- **Introduction of Prompt Engineering**: A new section providing an overview of prompt engineering and its relevance to Claude models.
- **Guidance on Pre-requisites**: Clear criteria for developers to establish before beginning prompt engineering, emphasizing the importance of success metrics.
- **Comparison with Fine-tuning**: Detailed advantages of prompt engineering over fine-tuning, including resource efficiency, cost-effectiveness, and flexibility.
- **Structured Techniques**: A list of effective prompt engineering techniques organized from broad to specialized, guiding developers through troubleshooting.
- **Interactive Learning Resources**: Links to interactive tutorials for hands-on learning, enhancing the practical understanding of prompt engineering.

## Impact
**Medium**: This change improves the documentation significantly, providing developers with essential insights and structured guidance, which can lead to better utilization of Claude&#39;s capabilities. It does not introduce new features but enhances the understanding and application of existing ones.</div>

+While these tips apply broadly to all Claude models, you can find prompting tips specific to extended thinking models [here](/docs/en/build-with-claude/prompt-engineering/extended-thinking-tips).

+
+## Before prompt engineering
+
+This guide assumes that you have:
+1. A clear definition of the success criteria for your use case
+2. Some ways to empirically test against those criteria
+3. A first draft prompt you want to improve
+
+If not, we highly suggest you spend time establishing that first. Check out [Define your success criteria](/docs/en/test-and-evaluate/define-success) and [Create strong empirical evaluations](/docs/en/test-and-evaluate/develop-tests) for tips and guidance.

+
+## When to prompt engineer
+
+  This guide focuses on success criteria that are controllable through prompt engineering.
+  Not every success criteria or failing eval is best solved by prompt engineering. For example, latency and cost can be sometimes more easily improved by selecting a different model.
+
+&lt;section title=&#34;Prompting vs. finetuning&#34;&gt;
+
+  Prompt engineering is far faster than other methods of model behavior control, such as finetuning, and can often yield leaps in performance in far less time. Here are some reasons to consider prompt engineering over finetuning:&lt;br/&gt;
+  - **Resource efficiency**: Fine-tuning requires high-end GPUs and large memory, while prompt engineering only needs text input, making it much more resource-friendly.
+  - **Cost-effectiveness**: For cloud-based AI services, fine-tuning incurs significant costs. Prompt engineering uses the base model, which is typically cheaper.
+  - **Maintaining model updates**: When providers update models, fine-tuned versions might need retraining. Prompts usually work across versions without changes.
+  - **Time-saving**: Fine-tuning can take hours or even days. In contrast, prompt engineering provides nearly instantaneous results, allowing for quick problem-solving.
+  - **Minimal data needs**: Fine-tuning needs substantial task-specific, labeled data, which can be scarce or expensive. Prompt engineering works with few-shot or even zero-shot learning.
+  - **Flexibility &amp; rapid iteration**: Quickly try various approaches, tweak prompts, and see immediate results. This rapid experimentation is difficult with fine-tuning.
+  - **Domain adaptation**: Easily adapt models to new domains by providing domain-specific context in prompts, without retraining.
+  - **Comprehension improvements**: Prompt engineering is far more effective than finetuning at helping models better understand and utilize external content such as retrieved documents
+  - **Preserves general knowledge**: Fine-tuning risks catastrophic forgetting, where the model loses general knowledge. Prompt engineering maintains the model&#39;s broad capabilities.
+  - **Transparency**: Prompts are human-readable, showing exactly what information the model receives. This transparency aids in understanding and debugging.
