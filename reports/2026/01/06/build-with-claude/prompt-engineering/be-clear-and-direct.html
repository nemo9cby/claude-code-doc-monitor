+# Be clear, direct, and detailed
+
+---
+
+&lt;Note&gt;
+While these tips apply broadly to all Claude models, you can find prompting tips specific to extended thinking models [here](/docs/en/build-with-claude/prompt-engineering/extended-thinking-tips).
+&lt;/Note&gt;
+
+When interacting with Claude, think of it as a brilliant but very new employee (with amnesia) who needs explicit instructions. Like any new employee, Claude does not have context on your norms, styles, guidelines, or preferred ways of working.
+The more precisely you explain what you want, the better Claude&#39;s response will be.
+
+&lt;Tip&gt;**The golden rule of clear prompting**&lt;br/&gt;Show your prompt to a colleague, ideally someone who has minimal context on the task, and ask them to follow the instructions. If they&#39;re confused, Claude will likely be too.&lt;/Tip&gt;
+
+## How to be clear, contextual, and specific
+
+- **Give Claude contextual information:** Just like you might be able to better perform on a task if you knew more context, Claude will perform better if it has more contextual information. Some examples of contextual information:
+    - What the task results will be used for
+    - What audience the output is meant for
+    - What workflow the task is a part of, and where this task belongs in that workflow
+    - The end goal of the task, or what a successful task completion looks like
+- **Be specific about what you want Claude to do:** For example, if you want Claude to output only code and nothing else, say so.
+- **Provide instructions as sequential steps:** Use numbered lists or bullet points to better ensure that Claude carries out the task the exact way you want it to.
+
+### Examples
+
+    &lt;section title=&#34;Example: Anonymizing customer feedback&#34;&gt;
+
+    Notice that Claude still makes mistakes in the unclear prompting example, such as leaving in a customer&#39;s name.

+    | Assistant (Claude&#39;s response) | Here&#39;s a summary of the key points from the AcmeCloud outage report:&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;On May 15th, a misconfigured load balancer update caused significant traffic routing issues, resulting in a service outage from 09:15 to 13:52 UTC. The 4-hour 37-minute disruption impacted our core file syncing service and admin dashboard, rendering them inaccessible. Additionally, the mobile app experienced partial functionality loss. Approximately 68% of our user base, totaling 1.3 million users, were affected. Based on our Service Level Agreements (SLAs) and average revenue per user, we estimate a financial impact of $420,000 in service credits and potential customer churn. | 1) Cause: Misconfigured load balancer update&lt;br/&gt;2) Duration: 4h 37m (09:15-13:52 UTC, May 15)&lt;br/&gt;3) Impacted: Core sync, admin dashboard (down); mobile app (partial)&lt;br/&gt;4) Affected users: 1.3M (68% of base)&lt;br/&gt;5) Est. revenue loss: $420,000 |
