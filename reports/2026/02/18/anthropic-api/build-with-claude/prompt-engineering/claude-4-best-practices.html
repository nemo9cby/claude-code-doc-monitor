These models have been trained for more precise instruction following than previous generations of Claude models.&para;<br>&para;<br>&lt;Tip&gt;&para;<br>  For an overview of model capabilities, see the [models overview](/docs/en/about-claude/models/overview). For details on what's new in Claude 4.6, see [What's new in Claude 4.6](/docs/en/about-claude/models/whats-new-claude-4-6). For migration guidance, see the [Migration guide](/docs/en/about-claude/models/migration-guide).&para;<br>&lt;/Tip&gt;&para;<br>&para;<br>## General principles&para;<br>&para;<br>### Be explicit with your instructions&para;<br>&para;<br>Claude responds well to clear, explicit instructions. Being specific about your desired output can help enhance results. If you want "above and beyond" behavior, explicitly request it rather than relying on the model to infer this from vague prompts.&para;<br>&para;<br>&lt;section title="Example: Creating an analytics dashboard"&gt;&para;<br>&para;<br>**Less effective:**&para;<br>```text&para;<br>Create an analytics dashboard&para;<br>```&para;<br>&para;<br>**More effective:**&para;<br>```text&para;<br>Create an analytics dashboard. Include as many relevant features and interactions as possible. Go beyond the basics to create a fully-featured implementation.&para;<br>```&para;<br>&para;<br>&lt;/section&gt;&para;<br>&para;<br>### Add context to improve performance&para;<br>&para;<br>Providing context or motivation behind your instructions, such as explaining to Claude why such behavior is important, can help Claude better understand your goals and deliver more targeted responses.&para;<br>&para;<br>&lt;section title="Example: Formatting preferences"&gt;&para;<br>&para;<br>**Less effective:**&para;<br>```text&para;<br>NEVER use ellipses&para;<br>```&para;<br>&para;<br>**More effective:**&para;<br>```text&para;<br>Your response will be read aloud by a text-to-speech engine, so never use ellipses since the text-to-speech engine will not know how to pronounce them.&para;<br>```&para;<br>&para;<br>&lt;/section&gt;&para;<br>&para;<br>Claude is smart enough to generalize from the explanation.&para;<br>&para;<br>### Be vigilant with examples &amp; details&para;<br>&para;<br>Claude pays close attention to details and examples as part of its precise instruction following capabilities. Ensure that your examples align with the behaviors you want to encourage and minimize behaviors you want to avoid.&para;<br>&para;<br>### Long-horizon reasoning and state tracking&para;<br>&para;<br>Claude's latest models excel at long-horizon reasoning tasks with exceptional state tracking capabilities. Claude maintains orientation across extended sessions by focusing on incremental progress</span><del style="background:#ffe6e6;">—</del><ins style="background:#e6ffe6;">, </ins><span>making steady advances on a few things at a time rather than attempting everything at once. This capability especially emerges over multiple context windows or task iterations, where Claude can work on a complex task, save the state, and continue with a fresh context window.&para;<br>&para;<br>#### Context awareness and multi-window workflows&para;<br>&para;<br>Claude 4.6 and Claude 4.5 models feature [context awareness](/docs/en/build-with-claude/context-windows#context-awareness-in-claude-sonnet-46-sonnet-45-and-haiku-45), enabling the model to track its remaining context window (i.e. "token budget") throughout a conversation. This enables Claude to execute tasks and manage context more effectively by understanding how much space it has to work.&para;<br>&para;<br>**Managing context limits:**&para;<br>&para;<br>If you are using Claude in an agent harness that compacts context or allows saving context to external files (like in Claude Code), </span><del style="background:#ffe6e6;">we suggest</del><ins style="background:#e6ffe6;">consider</ins><span> adding this information to your prompt so Claude can behave accordingly. Otherwise, Claude may sometimes naturally try to wrap up work as it approaches the context limit. Below is an example prompt:&para;<br>&para;<br>```text Sample prompt&para;<br>Your context window will be automatically compacted as it approaches its limit, allowing you to continue working indefinitely from where you left off. Therefore, do not stop tasks early due to token budget concerns. As you approach your token budget limit, save your current progress and state to memory before the context window refreshes. Always be as persistent and autonomous as possible and complete tasks fully, even if the end of your budget is approaching. Never artificially stop any task early regardless of the context remaining.&para;<br>```&para;<br>&para;<br>The [memory tool](/docs/en/agents-and-tools/tool-use/memory-tool) pairs naturally with context awareness for seamless context transitions.&para;<br>&para;<br>#### Multi-context window workflows&para;<br>&para;<br>For tasks spanning multiple context windows:&para;<br>&para;<br>1. **Use a different prompt for the very first context window**: Use the first context window to set up a framework (write tests, create setup scripts), then use future context windows to iterate on a todo-list.&para;<br>&para;<br>2. **Have the model write tests in a structured format**: Ask Claude to create tests before starting work and keep track of them in a structured format (e.g., `tests.json`). This leads to better long-term ability to iterate. Remind Claude of the importance of tests: "It is unacceptable to remove or edit tests because this could lead to missing or buggy functionality."&para;<br>&para;<br>3. **Set up quality of life tools**: Encourage Claude to create setup scripts (e.g., `init.sh`) to gracefully start servers, run test suites, and linters. This prevents repeated work when continuing from a fresh context window.&para;<br>&para;<br>4. **Starting fresh vs compacting**: When a context window is cleared, consider starting with a brand new context window rather than using compaction. Claude's latest models are extremely effective at discovering state from the local filesystem. In some cases, you may want to take advantage of this over compaction. Be prescriptive about how it should start:&para;<br>   - "Call pwd; you can only read and write files in this directory."&para;<br>   - "Review progress.txt, tests.json, and the git logs."&para;<br>   - "Manually run through a fundamental integration test before moving on to implementing new features."&para;<br>&para;<br>5. **Provide verification tools**: As the length of autonomous tasks grows, Claude needs to verify correctness without continuous human feedback. Tools like Playwright MCP server or computer use capabilities for testing UIs are helpful.&para;<br>&para;<br>6. **Encourage complete usage of context**: Prompt Claude to efficiently complete components before moving on:&para;<br>&para;<br>```text Sample prompt&para;<br>This is a very long task, so it may be beneficial to plan out your work clearly. It's encouraged to spend your entire output context working on the task - just make sure you don't run out of context with significant uncommitted work. Continue working systematically until you have completed this task.&para;<br>```&para;<br>&para;<br>#### State management best practices&para;<br>&para;<br>- **Use structured formats for state data**: When tracking structured information (like test results or task status), use JSON or other structured formats to help Claude understand schema requirements&para;<br>- **Use unstructured text for progress notes**: Freeform progress notes work well for tracking general progress and context&para;<br>- **Use git for state tracking**: Git provides a log of what's been done and checkpoints that can be restored. Claude's latest models perform especially well in using git to track state across multiple sessions.&para;<br>- **Emphasize incremental progress**: Explicitly ask Claude to keep track of its progress and focus on incremental work&para;<br>&para;<br>&lt;section title="Example: State tracking"&gt;&para;<br>&para;<br>```json&para;<br>// Structured state file (tests.json)&para;<br>{&para;<br>  "tests": [&para;<br>    {"id": 1, "name": "authentication_flow", "status": "passing"},&para;<br>    {"id": 2, "name": "user_management", "status": "failing"},&para;<br>    {"id": 3, "name": "api_endpoints", "status": "not_started"}&para;<br>  ],&para;<br>  "total": 200,&para;<br>  "passing": 150,&para;<br>  "failing": 25,&para;<br>  "not_started": 25&para;<br>}&para;<br>```&para;<br>&para;<br>```text&para;<br>// Progress notes (progress.txt)&para;<br>Session 3 progress:&para;<br>- Fixed authentication token validation&para;<br>- Updated user model to handle edge cases&para;<br>- Next: investigate user_management test failures (test #2)&para;<br>- Note: Do not remove tests as this could lead to missing functionality&para;<br>```&para;<br>&para;<br>&lt;/section&gt;&para;<br>&para;<br>### Communication style&para;<br>&para;<br>Claude's latest models have a more concise and natural communication style compared to previous models:&para;<br>&para;<br>- **More direct and grounded**: Provides fact-based progress reports rather than self-celebratory updates&para;<br>- **More conversational**: Slightly more fluent and colloquial, less machine-like&para;<br>- **Less verbose**: May skip detailed summaries for efficiency unless prompted otherwise&para;<br>&para;<br>This communication style accurately reflects what has been accomplished without unnecessary elaboration.&para;<br>&para;<br>## Guidance for specific situations&para;<br>&para;<br>### Balance verbosity&para;<br>&para;<br>Claude's latest models tend toward efficiency and may skip verbal summaries after tool calls, jumping directly to the next action. While this creates a streamlined workflow, you may prefer more visibility into its reasoning process.&para;<br>&para;<br>If you want Claude to provide updates as it works:&para;<br>&para;<br>```text Sample prompt&para;<br>After completing a task that involves tool use, provide a quick summary of the work you've done.&para;<br>```&para;<br>&para;<br>### Tool usage patterns&para;<br>&para;<br>Claude's latest models are trained for precise instruction following and benefit from explicit direction to use specific tools. If you say "can you suggest some changes," Claude will sometimes provide suggestions rather than implementing them</span><del style="background:#ffe6e6;">—</del><ins style="background:#e6ffe6;">, </ins><span>even if making changes might be what you intended.&para;<br>&para;<br>For Claude to take action, be more explicit:&para;<br>&para;<br>&lt;section title="Example: Explicit instructions"&gt;&para;<br>&para;<br>**Less effective (Claude will only suggest):**&para;<br>```text&para;<br>Can you suggest some changes to improve this function?&para;<br>```&para;<br>&para;<br>**More effective (Claude will make the changes):**&para;<br>```text&para;<br>Change this function to improve its performance.&para;<br>```&para;<br>&para;<br>Or:&para;<br>```text&para;<br>Make these edits to the authentication flow.&para;<br>```&para;<br>&para;<br>&lt;/section&gt;&para;<br>&para;<br>To make Claude more proactive about taking action by default, you can add this to your system prompt:&para;<br>&para;<br>```text Sample prompt for proactive action&para;<br>&lt;default_to_action&gt;&para;<br>By default, implement changes rather than only suggesting them. If the user's intent is unclear, infer the most useful likely action and proceed, using tools to discover any missing details instead of guessing. Try to infer the user's intent about whether a tool call (e.g., file edit or read) is intended or not, and act accordingly.&para;<br>&lt;/default_to_action&gt;&para;<br>```&para;<br>&para;<br>On the other hand, if you want the model to be more hesitant by default, less prone to jumping straight into implementations, and only take action if requested, you can steer this behavior with a prompt like the below:&para;<br>&para;<br>```text Sample prompt for conservative action&para;<br>&lt;do_not_act_before_instructions&gt;&para;<br>Do not jump into implementatation or changes files unless clearly instructed to make changes. When the user's intent is ambiguous, default to providing information, doing research, and providing recommendations rather than taking action. Only proceed with edits, modifications, or implementations when the user explicitly requests them.&para;<br>&lt;/do_not_act_before_instructions&gt;&para;<br>```&para;<br>&para;<br>### Tool usage and triggering&para;<br>&para;<br>Claude Opus 4.5 and Claude 4.6 models are more responsive to the system prompt than previous models. If your prompts were designed to reduce undertriggering on tools or skills, these models may now overtrigger. The fix is to dial back any aggressive language. Where you might have said "CRITICAL: You MUST use this tool when...", you can use more normal prompting like "Use this tool when...".&para;<br>&para;<br>### Balancing autonomy and safety&para;<br>&para;<br>Without guidance, Claude Opus 4.6 may take actions that are difficult to reverse or affect shared systems, such as deleting files, force-pushing, or posting to external services. If you want Claude Opus 4.6 to confirm before taking potentially risky actions, add guidance to your prompt:&para;<br>&para;<br>```text Sample prompt&para;<br>Consider the reversibility and potential impact of your actions. You are encouraged to take local, reversible actions like editing files or running tests, but for actions that are hard to reverse, affect shared systems, or could be destructive, ask the user before proceeding.&para;<br>&para;<br>Examples of actions that warrant confirmation:&para;<br>- Destructive operations: deleting files or branches, dropping database tables, rm -rf&para;<br>- Hard to reverse operations: git push --force, git reset --hard, amending published commits&para;<br>- Operations visible to others: pushing code, commenting on PRs/issues, sending messages, modifying shared infrastructure&para;<br>&para;<br>When encountering obstacles, do not use destructive actions as a shortcut. For example, don't bypass safety checks (e.g. --no-verify) or discard unfamiliar files that may be in-progress work.&para;<br>```&para;<br>&para;<br>### Overthinking and excessive thoroughness&para;<br>&para;<br>Claude 4.6 models do significantly more upfront exploration than previous models, especially at higher `effort` settings. This initial work often helps to optimize the final results, but the models may gather extensive context or pursue multiple threads of research without being prompted. If your prompts previously encouraged the model to be more thorough, you should tune that guidance for Claude 4.6 models:&para;<br>&para;<br>- **Remove anti-laziness prompts.** Instructions like "be thorough," "think carefully," or "do not be lazy" were common workarounds for earlier models. On Claude 4.6 models, these amplify the model's already-proactive behavior and can cause runaway thinking or write-then-rewrite loops.&para;<br>- **Soften tool-use language.** Replace "You must use \[tool\]" or "If in doubt, use \[tool\]" with "Use \[tool\] when it would enhance your understanding of the problem." Tools that undertriggered in previous models are likely to trigger appropriately now.&para;<br>- **Remove explicit think tool instructions.** Instructions like "use the think tool to plan your approach" cause the models to over-plan. They think effectively without being told to.&para;<br>- **Use effort as the primary control lever.** If the model is still overly aggressive after prompt cleanup, lower the effort setting rather than adding more prompt constraints.&para;<br>&para;<br>In some cases, these models may think extensively, which can inflate thinking tokens and slow down responses. If this behavior is undesirable, you can add explicit instructions to constrain reasoning, or lower the `effort` setting to reduce overall thinking and token usage.&para;<br>&para;<br>```text Sample prompt&para;<br>Prioritize execution over deliberation. Choose one approach and start producing output immediately. Do not compare alternatives or plan the entire solution before writing. Do not exhaustively explore before starting; begin with what you know. Write each piece of work once; do not go back to revise or rewrite. If uncertain about a detail, make a reasonable choice and continue. Only course-correct if you encounter a concrete failure.&para;<br>```&para;<br>&para;<br>For Claude Sonnet 4.6 specifically, switching from adaptive to extended thinking with a `budget_tokens` cap provides a hard ceiling on thinking costs while preserving quality.&para;<br>&para;<br>### Control the format of responses&para;<br>&para;<br>There are a few </span><del style="background:#ffe6e6;">ways that we have found to be </del><span>particularly effective </span><del style="background:#ffe6e6;">in</del><ins style="background:#e6ffe6;">ways to</ins><span> steer</span><del style="background:#ffe6e6;">ing</del><span> output formatting:&para;<br>&para;<br>1. **Tell Claude what to do instead of what not to do**&para;<br>&para;<br>   - Instead of: "Do not use markdown in your response"&para;<br>   - Try: "Your response should be composed of smoothly flowing prose paragraphs."&para;<br>&para;<br>2. **Use XML format indicators**&para;<br>&para;<br>   - Try: "Write the prose sections of your response in \&lt;smoothly_flowing_prose_paragraphs\&gt; tags."&para;<br>&para;<br>3. **Match your prompt style to the desired output**&para;<br>&para;<br>   The formatting style used in your prompt may influence Claude's response style. If you are still experiencing steerability issues with output formatting, </span><del style="background:#ffe6e6;">we recommend as best as you can</del><ins style="background:#e6ffe6;">try to</ins><span> match</span><del style="background:#ffe6e6;">ing</del><span> your prompt style to your desired output style</span><ins style="background:#e6ffe6;"> as closely as possible</ins><span>. For example, removing markdown from your prompt can reduce the volume of markdown in the output.&para;<br>&para;<br>4. **Use detailed prompts for specific formatting preferences**&para;<br>&para;<br>   For more control over markdown and formatting usage, provide explicit guidance:&para;<br>&para;<br>```text Sample prompt to minimize markdown&para;<br>&lt;avoid_excessive_markdown_and_bullet_points&gt;&para;<br>When writing reports, documents, technical explanations, analyses, or any long-form content, write in clear, flowing prose using complete paragraphs and sentences. Use standard paragraph breaks for organization and reserve markdown primarily for `inline code`, code blocks (```...```), and simple headings (###, and ###). Avoid using **bold** and *italics*.&para;<br>&para;<br>DO NOT use ordered lists (1. ...) or unordered lists (*) unless : a) you're presenting truly discrete items where a list format is the best option, or b) the user explicitly requests a list or ranking&para;<br>&para;<br>Instead of listing items with bullets or numbers, incorporate them naturally into sentences. This guidance applies especially to technical writing. Using prose instead of excessive formatting will improve user satisfaction. NEVER output a series of overly short bullet points.&para;<br>&para;<br>Your goal is readable, flowing text that guides the reader naturally through ideas rather than fragmenting information into isolated points.&para;<br>&lt;/avoid_excessive_markdown_and_bullet_points&gt;&para;<br>```&para;<br>&para;<br>### Research and information gathering&para;<br>&para;<br>Claude's latest models demonstrate exceptional agentic search capabilities and can find and synthesize information from multiple sources effectively. For optimal research results:&para;<br>&para;<br>1. **Provide clear success criteria**: Define what constitutes a successful answer to your research question&para;<br>&para;<br>2. **Encourage source verification**: Ask Claude to verify information across multiple sources&para;<br>&para;<br>3. **For complex research tasks, use a structured approach**:&para;<br>&para;<br>```text Sample prompt for complex research&para;<br>Search for this information in a structured way. As you gather data, develop several competing hypotheses. Track your confidence levels in your progress notes to improve calibration. Regularly self-critique your approach and plan. Update a hypothesis tree or research notes file to persist information and provide transparency. Break down this complex research task systematically.&para;<br>```&para;<br>&para;<br>This structured approach allows Claude to find and synthesize virtually any piece of information and iteratively critique its findings, no matter the size of the corpus.&para;<br>&para;<br>### Subagent orchestration&para;<br>&para;<br>Claude's latest models demonstrate significantly improved native subagent orchestration capabilities. These models can recognize when tasks would benefit from delegating work to specialized subagents and do so proactively without requiring explicit instruction.&para;<br>&para;<br>To take advantage of this behavior:&para;<br>&para;<br>1. **Ensure well-defined subagent tools**: Have subagent tools available and described in tool definitions&para;<br>2. **Let Claude orchestrate naturally**: Claude will delegate appropriately without explicit instruction&para;<br>3. **Watch for overuse**: Claude Opus 4.6 has a strong predilection for subagents and may spawn them in situations where a simpler, direct approach would suffice. For example, the model may spawn subagents for code exploration when a direct grep call is faster and sufficient.&para;<br>&para;<br>If you're seeing excessive subagent use, add explicit guidance about when subagents are and aren't warranted:&para;<br>&para;<br>```text Sample prompt for subagent usage&para;<br>Use subagents when tasks can run in parallel, require isolated context, or involve independent workstreams that don't need to share state.

In frontend design, this creates what users call the "AI slop" aesthetic. Avoid this: make creative, distinctive frontends that surprise and delight.&para;<br>&para;<br>Focus on:&para;<br>- Typography: Choose fonts that are beautiful, unique, and interesting. Avoid generic fonts like Arial and Inter; opt instead for distinctive choices that elevate the frontend's aesthetics.&para;<br>- Color &amp; Theme: Commit to a cohesive aesthetic. Use CSS variables for consistency. Dominant colors with sharp accents outperform timid, evenly-distributed palettes. Draw from IDE themes and cultural aesthetics for inspiration.&para;<br>- Motion: Use animations for effects and micro-interactions. Prioritize CSS-only solutions for HTML. Use Motion library for React when available. Focus on high-impact moments: one well-orchestrated page load with staggered reveals (animation-delay) creates more delight than scattered micro-interactions.&para;<br>- Backgrounds: Create atmosphere and depth rather than defaulting to solid colors. Layer CSS gradients, use geometric patterns, or add contextual effects that match the overall aesthetic.&para;<br>&para;<br>Avoid generic AI-generated aesthetics:&para;<br>- Overused font families (Inter, Roboto, Arial, system fonts)&para;<br>- Clichéd color schemes (particularly purple gradients on white backgrounds)&para;<br>- Predictable layouts and component patterns&para;<br>- Cookie-cutter design that lacks context-specific character&para;<br>&para;<br>Interpret creatively and make unexpected choices that feel genuinely designed for the context. Vary between light and dark themes, different fonts, different aesthetics. You still tend to converge on common choices (Space Grotesk, for example) across generations. Avoid this: it is critical that you think outside the box!&para;<br>&lt;/frontend_aesthetics&gt;&para;<br>```&para;<br>&para;<br>You can also refer to the </span><ins style="background:#e6ffe6;">[</ins><span>full skill </span><del style="background:#ffe6e6;">[here</del><ins style="background:#e6ffe6;">definition</ins><span>](https://github.com/anthropics/claude-code/blob/main/plugins/frontend-design/skills/frontend-design/SKILL.md).&para;<br>&para;<br>### Avoid focusing on passing tests and hard-coding&para;<br>&para;<br>Claude can sometimes focus too heavily on making tests pass at the expense of more general solutions, or may use workarounds like helper scripts for complex refactoring instead of using standard tools directly. To prevent this behavior and ensure robust, generalizable solutions:&para;<br>&para;<br>```text Sample prompt&para;<br>Please write a high-quality, general-purpose solution using the standard tools available. Do not create helper scripts or workarounds to accomplish the task more efficiently. Implement a solution that works correctly for all valid inputs, not just the test cases. Do not hard-code values or create solutions that only work for specific test inputs. Instead, implement the actual logic that solves the problem generally.&para;<br>&para;<br>Focus on understanding the problem requirements and implementing the correct algorithm. Tests are there to verify correctness, not to define the solution. Provide a principled implementation that follows best practices and software design principles.&para;<br>&para;<br>If the task is unreasonable or infeasible, or if any of the tests are incorrect, please inform me rather than working around them. The solution should be robust, maintainable, and extendable.&para;<br>```&para;<br>&para;<br>### Minimizing hallucinations in agentic coding&para;<br>&para;<br>Claude's latest models are less prone to hallucinations and give more accurate, grounded, intelligent answers based on the code. To encourage this behavior even more and minimize hallucinations:&para;<br>&para;<br>```text Sample prompt&para;<br>&lt;investigate_before_answering&gt;&para;<br>Never speculate about code you have not opened. If the user references a specific file, you MUST read the file before answering. Make sure to investigate and read relevant files BEFORE answering questions about the codebase. Never make any claims about code before investigating unless you are certain of the correct answer - give grounded and hallucination-free answers.&para;<br>&lt;/investigate_before_answering&gt;&para;<br>```&para;<br>&para;<br>### Migrating away from prefilled responses&para;<br>&para;<br>Starting with Claude 4.6 models, prefilled responses on the last assistant turn are no longer supported. Prefills have been a common vector for jailbreaks and other exploits. Model intelligence and instruction following has advanced such that most use cases of prefill no longer require it.

Try simply asking the model to conform to your output structure first, as newer models can reliably match complex schemas when told to, especially if implemented with retries. For classification tasks, use either tools with an enum field containing your valid labels or structured outputs.&para;<br>&para;<br>&lt;/section&gt;&para;<br>&para;<br>&lt;section title="Eliminating preambles"&gt;&para;<br>&para;<br>Prefills like `Here is the requested summary:\n` were used to skip introductory text.&para;<br>&para;<br>**Migration:** Use direct instructions in the system prompt: "Respond directly without preamble. Do not start with phrases like 'Here is...', 'Based on...', etc." Alternatively, direct the model to output within XML tags, use structured outputs, or use tool calling. If the occasional preamble slips through, strip it in post-processing.&para;<br>&para;<br>&lt;/section&gt;&para;<br>&para;<br>&lt;section title="Avoiding bad refusals"&gt;&para;<br>&para;<br>Prefills were used to steer around unnecessary refusals.&para;<br>&para;<br>**Migration:** Claude is much better at appropriate refusals now.

Continue from where you left off." If this is part of error-handling or incomplete-response-handling and there is no UX penalty, retry the request.&para;<br>&para;<br>&lt;/section&gt;&para;<br>&para;<br>&lt;section title="Context hydration and role consistency"&gt;&para;<br>&para;<br>Prefills were used to periodically ensure refreshed or injected context.&para;<br>&para;<br>**Migration:** For very long conversations, inject what were previously prefilled-assistant reminders into the user turn.

If you prefer plain text, add the following instructions to your prompt:&para;<br>&para;<br>```text Sample prompt&para;<br>Format your response in plain text only. Do not use LaTeX, MathJax, or any markup notation such as \( \), $, or \frac{}{}. Write all math expressions using standard text characters (e.g., "/" for division, "*" for multiplication, and "^" for exponents).&para;<br>```&para;<br>&para;<br>## Migration considerations&para;<br>&para;<br>When migrating to Claude 4.6 models from earlier generations:&para;<br>&para;<br>1. **Be specific about desired behavior**: Consider describing exactly what you'd like to see in the output.&para;<br>&para;<br>2. **Frame your instructions with modifiers**: Adding modifiers that encourage Claude to increase the quality and detail of its output can help better shape Claude's performance. For example, instead of "Create an analytics dashboard", use "Create an analytics dashboard. Include as many relevant features and interactions as possible. Go beyond the basics to create a fully-featured implementation."&para;<br>&para;<br>3. **Request specific features explicitly**: Animations and interactive elements should be requested explicitly when desired.&para;<br>&para;<br>4. **Update thinking configuration**: Claude 4.6 models use [adaptive thinking](/docs/en/build-with-claude/adaptive-thinking) (`thinking: {type: "adaptive"}`) instead of manual thinking with `budget_tokens`. Use the [effort parameter](/docs/en/build-with-claude/effort) to control thinking depth.&para;<br>&para;<br>5. **Migrate away from prefilled responses**: Prefilled responses on the last assistant turn are deprecated starting with Claude 4.6 models. See [Migrating away from prefilled responses](#migrating-away-from-prefilled-responses) for detailed guidance on alternatives.&para;<br>&para;<br>6. **Tune anti-laziness prompting**: If your prompts previously encouraged the model to be more thorough or use tools more aggressively, dial back that guidance.

 Your context window will be automatically compacted as it approaches its limit, allowing you to continue working indefinitely from where you left off.

These improvements carry over to computer use, where the models can more reliably interpret screenshots and UI elements. You can also use these models to analyze videos by breaking them up into frames.
 
-One technique we&#39;ve found effective to further boost performance is to give Claude a crop tool or [skill](/docs/en/agents-and-tools/agent-skills/overview). We&#39;ve seen consistent uplift on image evaluations when Claude is able to &#34;zoom&#34; in on relevant regions of an image. We&#39;ve put together a cookbook for the crop tool [here](https://platform.claude.com/cookbook/multimodal-crop-tool).

 Claude Opus 4.5 and Claude Opus 4.6 excel at building complex, real-world web applications with strong frontend design. However, without guidance, models can default to generic patterns that create what users call the &#34;AI slop&#34; aesthetic. To create distinctive, creative frontends that surprise and delight:

 ### Migrating from Claude Sonnet 4.5 to Claude Sonnet 4.6
 
-Claude Sonnet 4.6 defaults to an effort level of `high`, in contrast to Claude Sonnet 4.5 which had no effort parameter. We recommend adjusting the effort parameter as you migrate from Claude Sonnet 4.5 to Claude Sonnet 4.6. If not explicitly set, you may experience higher latency with the default effort level.
+Claude Sonnet 4.6 defaults to an effort level of `high`, in contrast to Claude Sonnet 4.5 which had no effort parameter. Consider adjusting the effort parameter as you migrate from Claude Sonnet 4.5 to Claude Sonnet 4.6. If not explicitly set, you may experience higher latency with the default effort level.
 
 **Recommended effort settings:**
 - **Medium** for most applications
 - **Low** for high-volume or latency-sensitive workloads
 - Set a large max output token budget (64k tokens recommended) at medium or high effort to give the model room to think and act
 
-**When to use Opus 4.6 instead:** For the hardest, longest-horizon problems—large-scale code migrations, deep research, extended autonomous work—Opus 4.6 remains the right choice. Sonnet 4.6 is optimized for workloads where fast turnaround and cost efficiency matter most.

We recommend keeping a thinking budget around 16k tokens. In practice, most tasks don&#39;t use that much, but it provides headroom for harder problems without risk of runaway token usage.
