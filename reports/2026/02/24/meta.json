Let me look closer.\n            *   Actually, looking at the diffs provided in the prompt:\n                *   Diff 1 (be-clear-and-direct): Starts with `<!DOCTYPE html>...`. Changes are purely the HTML boilerplate (scripts/styles). The content part is missing or not shown in the diff snippet because the line count change is small (+3/-3) but the HTML head is huge. It's likely the *actual* content change is hidden or these are just build artifacts being compared.\n                *   *Wait, let's re-read the diff format.*\n                *   The diff shows `@@ -1,4 +1,4 @@`. This means only the first 4 lines changed.\n                *   The content is literally `<html>...` and the `nonce` values or script hashes are changing.\n                *   *Crucial Observation:* There are **zero** changes to the actual markdown text content visible in these diffs. The diffs are strictly showing changes to the *generated HTML output* or build artifacts (specifically CSP nonces or hashes).\n        *   *Hypothesis:* The input is likely a diff of the *built* static HTML files, not the source Markdown. The changes (+3/-3) are superficial changes to the build artifacts (like CSP nonces, script chunks, or hash changes due to a rebuild), not actual documentation content updates.\n\n3.  **Evaluate the Significance (Impact Level):**\n    *   Since the changes are only in the HTML/CSS/JS build artifacts (nonces, hashes) and not in the textual content of the documentation itself:\n    *   **Impact Level:** **Low**.\n    *   **Reasoning:** These are non-functional changes related to the site's build process (e.g., Content Security Policy nonces, cache busting, or a minor rebuild). The documentation content for developers (prompts, tips, engineering guides) remains unchanged based on the provided diffs.\n\n4.  **Draft the Analysis (in Chinese):**\n\n    *   **Overall Summary:** \u672c\u6b21\u53d8\u66f4\u6d89\u53ca `build-with-claude/prompt-engineering` \u4e0b\u7684 8 \u4e2a\u9875\u9762\u3002\u6240\u6709\u53d8\u66f4\u5747\u4e3a\u6784\u5efa\u4ea7\u7269\u5c42\u9762\u7684\u4fee\u6539\uff08\u5982 HTML \u5934\u90e8\u3001\u811a\u672c\u5f15\u7528\uff09\uff0c\u6587\u6863\u7684\u5b9e\u9645\u5185\u5bb9\u6ca1\u6709\u53d1\u751f\u4efb\u4f55\u53d8\u5316\u3002\n    *   **Key Themes:**\n        *   \u6784\u5efa\u5de5\u4ef6\u66f4\u65b0\n        *   CSP Nonce \u53d8\u5316\n        *   Next.js \u9759\u6001\u8d44\u6e90\u54c8\u5e0c\u53d8\u66f4\n        *   \u5185\u5bb9\u65e0\u53d8\u5316\n    *   **Impact Level:** Low.

"reasoning": "1.  **Understand the Goal:** The user wants a concise, insightful analysis of a batch of documentation changes. The output must be in Chinese, following a specific markdown format (Overall Summary, Key Themes, Impact Level, Action Items).\n\n2.  **Analyze the Input Data:**\n    *   **Total Changed Pages:** 9.\n    *   **Pages 1-8:** These are all `.md` files located under `build-with-claude/prompt-engineering/`.\n        *   `be-clear-and-direct.md`\n        *   `multishot-prompting.md`\n        *   `chain-of-thought.md`\n        *   `use-xml-tags.md`\n        *   `system-prompts.md`\n        *   `chain-prompts.md`\n        *   `long-context-tips.md`\n        *   `extended-thinking-tips.md`\n    *   **Diff Content for Pages 1-8:** The diffs provided show changes *only* in the first line of HTML structure. Specifically, the changes involve the `nonce` attribute values within the `<head>` tags.\n        *   Example: `nonce=\"n9cl1flKr1N2hiy10zSarw==\"` changed to something else (though the diff shows `--- a/...` and `+++ b/...`, the actual change line isn't explicitly visible in the snippet provided other than the header and the first line cut off).\n        *   Wait, looking closely at the provided diffs for Pages 1-8: They all show `+3 / -3`. The content visible is just the start of the HTML `<!DOCTYPE html...` line. It looks like the `nonce` attribute changed or a hash changed in the link/script tags. This is typical of a static site generator rebuild (Next.js) where asset hashes or nonces change on every build.\n        *   *Crucially*: There is *no* actual text content change in the documentation text itself shown in the diffs. It's all HTML boilerplate hashes.\n    *   **Page 9:** `CHANGELOG.md.md` (Note: double extension `.md.md` looks like a typo in the source or just the filename provided).\n        *   Diff Content: Added a new entry for version `2.1.52`.\n        *   Change: \"VS Code: Fixed extension crash on Windows ('command 'claude-vscode.editor.openLast' not found')\".\n\n3.  **Synthesize the Findings:**\n    *   **Documentation Content (Pages 1-8):** No actual content changes. The diffs are purely build artifacts (HTML hashes/nonces). This suggests a redeployment of the site without content modifications.\n    *   **Product Release (Page 9):** Version `2.1.52` of the VS Code extension was released. It fixes a specific crash issue on Windows related to a missing command.\n\n4.  **Drafting the Analysis (in Chinese):**\n\n    *   **Overall Summary:** Most changes are just HTML build artifacts (nonces/hashes). The actual substance is a new VS Code extension version (2.1.52) fixing a Windows crash bug.\n        *   *Draft (CN):* \u6b64\u6b21\u66f4\u65b0\u4e3b\u8981\u5305\u542b VS Code \u6269\u5c55\u7684\u65b0\u7248\u672c\u53d1\u5e03\uff0c\u4fee\u590d\u4e86 Windows \u5e73\u53f0\u4e0a\u7684\u5d29\u6e83\u95ee\u9898\u3002\u5176\u4f59 8 \u4e2a\u9875\u9762\u4ec5\u5305\u542b\u6784\u5efa\u4ea7\u751f\u7684 HTML \u54c8\u5e0c\u53d8\u66f4\uff0c\u65e0\u5b9e\u8d28\u6027\u5185\u5bb9\u4fee\u6539\u3002\n\n    *   **Key Themes:**\n        *   Artifact regeneration/Rebuild.\n        *   Bug fix (VS Code extension on Windows).\n        *   *Draft (CN):*\n            *   \u6784\u5efa\u4ea7\u7269\u66f4\u65b0\uff1a\u5927\u90e8\u5206\u53d8\u66f4\u4ec5\u6d89\u53ca Next.js \u6784\u5efa\u8fc7\u7a0b\u4e2d\u7684 HTML nonce \u548c\u8d44\u6e90\u54c8\u5e0c\u503c\uff0c\u5c5e\u4e8e\u65e0\u5185\u5bb9\u7684\u91cd\u5efa\u3002\n            *   Bug \u4fee\u590d\uff1aVS Code \u6269\u8865\u4e01\u4fee\u590d\u4e86\u7279\u5b9a\u9519\u8bef\u547d\u4ee4\u5bfc\u81f4\u7684 Windows \u5d29\u6e83\u95ee\u9898\u3002\n\n    *   **Impact Level:**\n        *   Reasoning: The fix is for a crash.

documentation changes.\n    *   **Input:** 8 pages of diffs from `build-with-claude/prompt-engineering/`.\n    *   **Format:** Markdown, concise, insightful, Chinese response.\n    *   **Structure:** 1. Overall Summary, 2. Key Themes, 3. Impact Level, 4. Action Items.\n\n2.  **Analyze the Input Data (The Diffs):**\n    *   *Page 1:* `be-clear-and-direct.md` -> Diff shows `+3 / -3`. The content shown is an HTML `<head>` tag, specifically the `nonce` attributes changed (e.g., `22r2dLiTrufDzS5QFM7p0A==` vs old). The structure implies a rebuild or a hash change in the HTML source, not content changes.\n    *   *Page 2:* `multishot-prompting.md` -> `+3 / -3`. Again, HTML `<head>` with changing `nonce`.\n    *   *Page 3:* `chain-of-thought.md` -> `+3 / -3`. Same pattern.\n    *   *Page 4:* `use-xml-tags.md` -> `+3 / -3`. Same pattern.\n    *   *Page 5:* `system-prompts.md` -> `+3 / -3`. Same pattern.\n    *   *Page 6:* `chain-prompts.md` -> `+3 / -3`. Same pattern.\n    *   *Page 7:* `long-context-tips.md` -> `+3 / -3`. Same pattern.\n    *   *Page 8:* `extended-thinking-tips.md` -> `+3 / -3`. Same pattern.\n\n3.  **Synthesize the Findings:**\n    *   **What actually changed?** The visible changes are entirely within the HTML `<head>` tags. Specifically, the `nonce` values for the CSP (Content Security Policy) scripts and stylesheets have been regenerated.\n    *   **Did the content change?** No. There are no changes to the actual documentation text, code examples, or structure in the diffs provided.\n    *   **Why did this happen?** This is a typical side effect of a static site generator (like Next.js, which is evident from the file paths `/_next/static/...`) rebuilding the site. Nonces are generated at build time for security. Even if the content is identical, a new build generates new nonces.\n    *   **Theme:** Technical/Infrastructure artifact changes, not content updates.\n\n4.  **Draft the Analysis (in Chinese):**\n\n    *   *Overall Summary:* The documentation content has not changed. The modifications are solely infrastructure-related updates (specifically CSP nonces) resulting from a site rebuild.\n        *   *Chinese:* \u6587\u6863\u5185\u5bb9\u672c\u8eab\u6ca1\u6709\u53d8\u5316\u3002\u6b64\u6b21\u66f4\u65b0\u5b8c\u5168\u662f\u7531\u4e8e\u7ad9\u70b9\u91cd\u65b0\u6784\u5efa\u5bfc\u81f4\u7684\u57fa\u7840\u8bbe\u65bd\u7ea7\u522b\u53d8\u52a8\uff08\u4e3b\u8981\u662f CSP nonces \u7684\u66f4\u65b0\uff09\u3002\n\n    *   *Key Themes:*\n        *   No content updates.\n        *   Next.js static site rebuild artifacts.\n        *   CSP nonce regeneration.\n        *   *Chinese:* \u65e0\u5b9e\u8d28\u6027\u5185\u5bb9\u66f4\u65b0\uff1bNext.js \u9759\u6001\u7ad9\u70b9\u6784\u5efa\u4ea7\u7269\u66f4\u65b0\uff1bCSP nonce \u503c\u91cd\u65b0\u751f\u6210\u3002\n\n    *   *Impact Level:*\n        *   Low.

Don't over-explain HTML headers. Focus on the fact that *nothing changed for the developer*.\n\n    *   *Drafting the Markdown:*\n        1.  **Overall Summary:** This batch of changes represents a site rebuild with no actual content updates. All modifications are confined to the HTML `<head>` tags, specifically the regeneration of Content Security Policy (CSP) `nonce` values.\n        2.  **Key Themes:**\n            *   **Content Stasis:** Zero changes to the actual documentation text, examples, or logic.\n            *   **Build Artifacts:** Changes are strictly artifacts of the Next.js static generation process (`/_next/static/...`).\n            *   **Security Tokens:** The only deltas are randomized CSP nonces for script/style tags.\n        3.  **Impact Level:** **Low**\n            *   **Reasoning:** This is infrastructure noise. It affects how the HTML is served at the byte level but provides zero functional or informational value to the end-user or developer reading the docs.\n        4.  **Action items for developers:**\n            *   No actions required.\n            *   Ignore these diffs; they do not affect API behavior or best practices.\n\n6.  **Final Polish (Chinese):**\n    *   Translate accurately but maintain the technical precision.\n\n    *   *Summary:* \u6b64\u6b21\u66f4\u65b0\u5e76\u672a\u5305\u542b\u4efb\u4f55\u5b9e\u8d28\u6027\u7684\u6587\u6863\u5185\u5bb9\u53d8\u66f4\u3002\u6240\u6709\u4fee\u6539\u5747\u9650\u4e8e HTML `<head>` \u6807\u7b7e\u5185\u7684\u57fa\u7840\u8bbe\u65bd\u5c42\u9762\u53d8\u52a8\uff0c\u4e3b\u8981\u662f Next.js \u91cd\u65b0\u6784\u5efa\u65f6\u751f\u6210\u7684 CSP `nonce` \u503c\u53d1\u751f\u4e86\u968f\u673a\u53d8\u5316\u3002\n    *   *Themes:*\n        *   **\u96f6\u5185\u5bb9\u66f4\u65b0**\uff1a\u6587\u6863\u6b63\u6587\u3001\u793a\u4f8b\u4ee3\u7801\u53ca\u903b\u8f91\u672a\u505a\u4efb\u4f55\u4fee\u6539\u3002\n        *   **\u6784\u5efa\u4ea7\u7269\u53d8\u66f4**\uff1a\u5dee\u5f02\u5b8c\u5168\u6e90\u4e8e Next.js \u9759\u6001\u7ad9\u70b9\u751f\u6210\u8fc7\u7a0b\uff08SSG\uff09\u7684\u91cd\u65b0\u6784\u5efa\u3002\n        *   **\u5b89\u5168\u4ee4\u724c\u5237\u65b0**\uff1a\u552f\u4e00\u7684\u53d8\u52a8\u662f\u7528\u4e8e\u811a\u672c\u548c\u6837\u5f0f\u8868\u7684\u968f\u673a\u5316 CSP Nonce \u503c\u3002\n    *   *Impact:* **\u4f4e**\u3002\u8fd9\u662f\u6784\u5efa\u8fc7\u7a0b\u4ea7\u751f\u7684\u201c\u566a\u97f3\u201d\uff0c\u4e0d\u4f1a\u5f71\u54cd\u6587\u6863\u7684\u9605\u8bfb\u4f53\u9a8c\u6216 API \u7684\u529f\u80fd\u8868\u73b0\u3002\n    *   *Actions:* \u65e0\u9700\u4efb\u4f55\u884c\u52a8\u3002\u5f00\u53d1\u8005\u53ef\u4ee5\u5b89\u5168\u5730\u5ffd\u7565\u8fd9\u4e9b\u5dee\u5f02\uff0c\u5b83\u4eec\u4e0d\u5f71\u54cd Prompt Engineering \u7684\u6700\u4f73\u5b9e\u8df5\u6216 API \u884c\u4e3a\u3002\n\n7.  **Final Check against constraints:**\n    *   Concise?

The output must be in Chinese.\n\n2.  **Analyze the Input Data**:\n    *   Total pages changed: 8.\n    *   Common Pattern: All diffs show `+3 / -3`.\n    *   Content of Diffs: Every diff shows the first line of an HTML file (`<!DOCTYPE html>...`) changing. Specifically, the `nonce` attribute values in the `<head>` tags are changing (e.g., `EGaWEt6thGrTu7pKZYBOCA==` to some other value, or just a different `nonce` string in the `+` version compared to the `-` version).\n    *   *Wait, looking closer*: The diffs show the *entire* first line of the HTML file. The `+` version is the new HTML, and the `-` version is the old HTML. The key change is the `nonce` values for CSP (Content Security Policy). For example, in the first diff, the `nonce` in the old version is `EGaWEt6thGrTu7pKZYBOCA==` and in the new version, it's truncated at the end (`...`). Actually, the diff format is a bit confusing because it shows the whole line.\n    *   *Correction*: Let's look at the structure. The diff shows `---` (old) and `+++` (new). Both lines are extremely long HTML `<!DOCTYPE...` lines. The only meaningful change in the HTML string itself in the provided snippet is often truncated, but usually, when looking at diffs of HTML builds where everything else looks identical (same chunk hashes, same CSS files), and the only visual difference is a `nonce`, this is a build artifact update.\n    *   *Detailed Check*:\n        *   `be-clear-and-direct.md`: Old nonce `EGaWEt6thGrTu7pKZYBOCA==`. New nonce looks similar or truncated in view.\n        *   `multishot-prompting.md`: Old nonce `/ft9iedqQtUZTYU7OTdn/Q==`.\n        *   `chain-of-thought.md`: Old nonce `lM/53iIDMckkvzqN5yNw3A==`.\n        *   `use-xml-tags.md`: Old nonce `cypkGBpHXsnSbVipG0NB+A==`.\n        *   `system-prompts.md`: Old nonce `OSxBLEcG7BRXZBtSaU8QTg==`.\n        *   `chain-prompts.md`: Old nonce `zUbQYjJAe/4pufjHLeArAw==`.\n        *   `long-context-tips.md`: Old nonce `FblxLu9sXmzl2PVmmy3sBA==`.\n        *   `extended-thinking-tips.md`: Old nonce `VymxS+lGi+obf7w0Hjl6Aw==`.\n    *   *Observation*: The files listed are markdown files (`.md`), but the content inside the diff is **HTML**. This is highly indicative of a \"built\" documentation site (likely Next.js based on the `/_next/static/...` paths).\n    *   *The actual change*: The markdown files themselves haven't changed in content text (prompt engineering advice). Instead, the rendered HTML output of these files is being tracked. The change is purely technical: a re-build of the site resulting in different CSP nonces (randomly generated for security). The structure (chunk IDs like `webpack-a45144c89d92bf08.js`) appears identical in the text shown.\n    *   *Conclusion*: This is a **false positive** in terms of documentation *content* changes. The documentation content (the prompt engineering advice) has not changed. The HTML boilerplate (specifically the CSP `nonce`) has been regenerated.\n\n3.  **Drafting the Analysis**:\n\n    *   **Overall Summary**: No actual content changes detected in the documentation. The changes are limited to HTML build artifacts, specifically updates to Content Security Policy (CSP) nonces in the header of static HTML files.\n    *   **Key Themes**:\n        *   Build Artifact Regeneration.\n        *   CSP (Content Security Policy) Nonce updates.\n        *   No functional or semantic changes to the text content.\n    *   **Impact Level**: **None/Low**. It's purely a build change. The documentation content is identical. The prompt engineering tips (be clear, multishot, chain-of-thought, etc.) remain the same.\n    *   **Action Items**:\n        *   None required. Developers can ignore these changes as they do not reflect updates to API usage or best practices.\n\n4.  **Refining the Output (in Chinese)**:\n\n    *   *Overall Summary*: \u6b64\u6b21\u53d8\u66f4\u4ec5\u6d89\u53ca HTML \u6784\u5efa\u4ea7\u7269\uff08Build Artifacts\uff09\u7684\u91cd\u65b0\u751f\u6210\uff0c\u4e3b\u8981\u662f CSP Nonces \u7684\u66f4\u65b0\uff0c\u6587\u6863\u5b9e\u9645\u5185\u5bb9\u672a\u53d1\u751f\u6539\u53d8\u3002\n    *   *Key Themes*:\n        *   \u6784\u5efa\u7cfb\u7edf\u91cd\u65b0\u6e32\u67d3\n        *   HTML \u5934\u90e8 CSP Nonce \u66f4\u65b0\n        *   \u65e0\u8bed\u4e49\u5185\u5bb9\u53d8\u66f4\n    *   *Impact Level*: **None** (\u65e0\u5f71\u54cd).

Yes.\n    *   Concise and insightful? Yes.\n    *   Focus on what matters to developers? Yes (telling them it doesn't matter is the most important insight).\n    *   Chinese reply? Yes.\n\n    *Self-Correction during drafting*: I initially thought about \"Low\" impact, but since the documentation content is exactly the same, and these look like generated HTML files being tracked in git (which is sometimes done for static hosting), the impact on the *developer reading the docs* is actually **None**. The *impact level* asked for is \"what matters to developers\". Developers using the docs won't see any difference. Developers maintaining the docs might care about build hashes, but that's infrastructure, not content. I'll label it \"None/Ignore\".\n\n    *Wait, let's look at the file paths again*: `build-with-claude/prompt-engineering/*.md`. The extensions are `.md`, but the content is `<!DOCTYPE html>`. This implies the diff tool is comparing the *source* markdown files, but the source files *contain* HTML? No, that's unlikely for a prompt engineering guide. It's far more likely that the user provided the diffs of the **rendered output** (HTML) but named them with the `.md` path for context, or the repo stores pre-rendered HTML. Regardless of the *why*, the *what* is clearly just HTML boilerplate changes. The content is identical.\n\n    I will stick to the conclusion: No content update.\n\n6.  **Final Polish (Markdown)**:\n    ```markdown\n    # \u6587\u6863\u53d8\u66f4\u5206\u6790\n\n    ## 1.

batch of 8 documentation changes as a single batch. Summarize changes and explain why they matter.\n    *   **Format:** Concise, insightful markdown.\n    *   **Language:** Chinese.\n    *   **Input:** 8 diffs showing HTML/Next.js build artifacts (nonce values changing in `<script>` and `<link>` tags).\n\n2.  **Analyze the Input Data (Diffs):**\n    *   *Page 1:* `build-with-claude/prompt-engineering/be-clear-and-direct.md`\n        *   Diff: Shows a long line of HTML. The only visible change is in the `nonce` attribute of `<link>` and `<script>` tags.\n        *   Example change: `nonce=\"roSIYW4pFBDyWLQBYlVQ9A==\"` -> `nonce=\"roSIYW4pFBDyWLQBYlVQ9A==\"` (Wait, the prompt shows `+3 / -3` lines, but usually, these diffs show the HTML head. Let's look closely at the provided diff block).\n        *   *Correction/Refinement:* The diffs provided are truncated HTML heads of a Next.js application. The specific changes are within the `nonce` attributes of the script/link tags. These nonces are random strings generated by the server for Content Security Policy (CSP). They change every time the page is built or served to prevent replay attacks.\n        *   *Observation:* The diffs provided in the prompt text *only* show the head section. The `+3 / -3` count suggests minimal changes, but looking at the raw text, the only thing that changes significantly in these automated builds is the `nonce` values and potentially the order of chunks (though the order looks consistent here).\n        *   *Wait, let's look at the diffs more carefully.*\n            *   `be-clear-and-direct.md`: `nonce=\"roSIYW4pFBDyWLQBYlVQ9A==\"` vs `nonce=\"6DfUIGI4l68oBaNsjKd/WA==\"` (comparing between files isn't right, I need to compare \"a\" and \"b\" in each diff).\n            *   *Problem:* The diffs provided show `--- a/...` and `+++ b/...`. But the content displayed is just the `+++ b/...` side (the new version), or rather, the unified diff view usually shows `---` (old) and `+++` (new). Here, the \"old\" and \"new\" blocks look identical in terms of structure, but the `nonce` values are different between the `-` line and the `+` line?\n            *   *Re-examining the input format:* The input shows `Diff:` followed by `--- a/...` then `+++ b/...`. The content block starts with `<!DOCTYPE html...`. This usually means the diff is showing the content, but perhaps the `nonce` values in the `---` version are different from the `+++` version.\n            *   *Actually*, looking at the specific strings:\n                *   Page 1: `---` has `nonce=\"roSIYW4pFBDyWLQBYlVQ9A==\"`, `+++` has `nonce=\"6DfUIGI4l68oBaNsjKd/WA==\"`. (Wait, the text provided in the prompt *only* shows the `+++` block or the unified diff output where the change is the nonce? No, the prompt text is: `Diff: --- a/... +++ b/... <!DOCTYPE...`.\n                *   *Standard Diff Interpretation:* The prompt text for the diff is truncated. It shows the header `--- a/...` and `+++ b/...` and then the content. If it's a unified diff, lines starting with `-` are removed, `+` are added.\n                *   *Crucial Check:* Does the provided text actually show the `-` and `+` prefixes on the specific lines?\n                *   Looking at the text provided: `@@ -1,4 +1,4 @@` followed by `<DOCTYPE...`.\n                *   *Wait, there is no `-` or `+` prefix on the HTML lines in the provided text?*\n                *   Let's look closely at the raw text provided for Page 1:\n                    `<!DOCTYPE html><html class=\"h-screen antialiased bg-bg-100 __variable_8d1da5 __variable_2d8cf6 __variable_e4195f\" lang=\"en\" data-theme=\"claude\" data-mode=\"auto\"><head><meta charSet=\"utf-8\"/><meta name=\"viewport\" content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, viewport-fit=\"cover\"/><link rel=\"stylesheet\" href=\"/_next/static/css/95b83e376d020c60.css\" nonce=\"roSIYW4pFBDyWLQBYlVQ9A==\" data-precedence=\"next\"/>...`\n                *   It does *not* explicitly show a `-` line vs a `+` line in the snippet provided. It just shows the HTML block. However, the stats say `+3 / -3`.\n                *   *Hypothesis:* These are documentation source files (`.md`) but the content shown is the *rendered* HTML output being stored in the git repo (which is unusual for docs, usually you store Markdown). Or, the user provided diffs of the *built/compiled* artifacts.\n                *   *Alternative Hypothesis:* The user pasted the output of a diff tool that compares HTML snapshots. The only thing that changes in these static HTML exports of Next.js pages are the `nonce` values for CSP and hash values.\n                *   *Key Realization:* These are **Non-content changes**. The changes are purely in the generated HTML (build artifacts), specifically the `nonce` attributes used for Content Security Policy (CSP). These are generated randomly or per-build.\n                *   *Why does this matter?* It doesn't matter to the content of the documentation. It matters only if the user is tracking these HTML files in git, which is generally a bad practice (build artifacts shouldn't be in source control).\n\n3.  **Synthesize the Analysis:**\n\n    *   **Overall Summary:** This batch contains 8 pages related to prompt engineering. However, the \"changes\" detected are strictly within the generated HTML build artifacts (Next.js output), specifically the `nonce` attributes for Content Security Policy. There are no changes to the actual documentation content, text, or markdown source.\n\n    *   **Key Themes:**\n        *   Build Artifacts in Git: The changes involve compiled HTML files rather than source `.md` files.\n        *   CSP Nonces: The specific diffs are changes to random `nonce` strings generated for security.\n        *   No Functional Updates: The actual developer-facing documentation content remains unchanged.\n\n    *   **Impact Level:** **Low** (or technically **None** for developers).\n        *   Reasoning: The changes are cosmetic/cryptographic build noise. They do not affect API usage, prompt engineering techniques, or code examples. In fact, if these files are in source control, it creates unnecessary churn.\n\n    *   **Action Items for Developers:**\n        *   Ignore these changes if reviewing content.\n        *   **Crucial Advice:** Advise removing these `.md` files (if they are actually HTML dumps) or configuring `.gitignore` to exclude `dist`, `.next`, or build artifacts if this is a static site generator output. (Wait, the filenames end in `.md` but the content is HTML. This implies the repository stores the *exported* HTML as markdown files, which is very odd, or the diff tool is comparing rendered snapshots.

**Analyze the Request:**\n    *   **Role:** World-class programmer analyzing documentation changes.\n    *   **Input:** A batch of 8 documentation pages (HTML source files, specifically the `<head>` section).\n    *   **Output:** Concise, insightful analysis in Markdown format.\n    *   **Format Requirements:**\n        1.  Overall Summary (1-2 sentences).\n        2.  Key Themes (bullets).\n        3.  Impact Level (Low/Medium/High/Breaking) with reasoning.\n        4.  Action Items (bullets, max 5).\n    *   **Language:** Chinese (as requested: \"\u8bf7\u7528\u4e2d\u6587\u56de\u590d\").\n\n2.  **Analyze the Data (The Diffs):**\n    *   *Observation 1:* All 8 files are located under `build-with-claude/prompt-engineering/`.\n        *   Specific files:\n            1.  `be-clear-and-direct.md`\n            2.  `multishot-prompting.md`\n            3.  `chain-of-thought.md`\n            4.  `use-xml-tags.md`\n            5.  `system-prompts.md`\n            6.  `chain-prompts.md`\n            7.  `long-context-tips.md`\n            8.  `extended-thinking-tips.md`\n    *   *Observation 2:* The diffs show changes in the HTML `<head>` section.\n    *   *Observation 3:* Looking closely at the diff content:\n        *   `--- a/...` vs `+++ b/...`\n        *   The content shown is almost entirely HTML boilerplate: `<!DOCTYPE html>`, `<html ...>`, `<head>`, `<meta ...>`, `<link rel=\"stylesheet\"...>`, `<script ...>`.\n    *   *Observation 4:* The actual change visible in the diff is extremely subtle. Let's look closer at the pattern.\n        *   Old: `nonce=\"QDS59C0OahNfMj+nS4b18g==\"` (example from file 1)\n        *   New: `nonce=\"...\"` (The nonce values change in every file).\n        *   Structure: It looks like the *entire file* is shown as changed because of a specific hash/nonce regeneration in the HTML header, likely due to a build process re-generating static assets or inline scripts/styles.\n    *   *Observation 5:* Wait, look at the first line of each diff.\n        *   `@@ -1,4 +1,4 @@` or similar.\n        *   This implies the first 4 lines (the HTML Doctype and opening tags) changed.\n        *   In HTML diffing tools (like standard unified diffs), if a non-content attribute (like a build hash or nonce) changes at the very top, it often flags the whole structure or just shows the changed attribute lines.\n        *   *Crucially:* Do we see any *content* changes? The actual Markdown content that developers read?\n        *   The diffs provided *only* show the HTML `<head>` and potentially the very start of the `<body>` (though cut off).\n        *   I need to look *very* closely to see if there are *any* text changes outside the nonces/scripts.\n        *   Let's scan the text blocks provided in the prompt.\n        *   File 1: `be-clear-and-direct.md`. Only HTML head changes.\n        *   File 2: `multishot-prompting.md`. Only HTML head changes.\n        *   File 3: `chain-of-thought.md`. Only HTML head changes.\n        *   ... and so on for all 8 files.\n\n    *   *Conclusion on Content:* There are **zero** content changes visible in the provided diffs. All changes are related to HTML build artifacts (CSP nonces, script hashes, or general build regeneration). The documentation text itself (the \"prompt engineering\" advice) has not changed in the snippets provided.\n\n3.  **Synthesize the Analysis (Drafting in English, then translating):**\n\n    *   *Overall Summary:* The batch changes affect 8 \"Prompt Engineering\" documentation pages. However, the diffs indicate only HTML build artifacts (nonces and script hashes) were updated, implying a deployment or build process refresh rather than actual documentation content updates.\n    *   *Key Themes:*\n        *   HTML Build System Updates: Changes are isolated to `<head>` elements (stylesheets, scripts).\n        *   CSP Nonce Regeneration: Security tokens (nonces) for scripts/styles were rotated.\n        *   No Content Changes: The textual information regarding prompt engineering remains unmodified.\n    *   *Impact Level:* **Low**. Since the actual documentation content hasn't changed, developers don't need to re-learn anything or update their code. It's likely just a site rebuild.\n    *   *Action Items:*\n        *   Ignore (content-wise).\n        *   Verify if this was a planned deployment.\n        *   No code changes required.\n\n4.  **Refine and Translate to Chinese:**\n\n    *   *Summary:* \u6b64\u6b21\u6279\u91cf\u66f4\u65b0\u6d89\u53ca 8 \u4e2a\u5173\u4e8e\u201c\u63d0\u793a\u8bcd\u5de5\u7a0b\u201d\u7684\u6587\u6863\u9875\u9762\u3002\u7136\u800c\uff0c\u5206\u6790\u663e\u793a\u6240\u6709\u53d8\u66f4\u4ec5\u9650\u4e8e HTML \u6784\u5efa\u4ea7\u7269\uff08\u5982 CSP Nonces \u548c\u811a\u672c\u54c8\u5e0c\u503c\uff09\uff0c\u8fd9\u610f\u5473\u7740\u8fd9\u662f\u4e00\u6b21\u6784\u5efa\u6216\u90e8\u7f72\u8fc7\u7a0b\u66f4\u65b0\uff0c\u800c\u975e\u6587\u6863\u5b9e\u9645\u5185\u5bb9\u7684\u4fee\u6539\u3002\n    *   *Themes:*\n        *   **\u6784\u5efa\u7cfb\u7edf\u5237\u65b0**\uff1a\u53d8\u66f4\u4ec5\u9650\u4e8e HTML `<head>` \u90e8\u5206\u7684\u6837\u5f0f\u8868\u548c\u811a\u672c\u5f15\u7528\u3002\n        *   **\u5b89\u5168\u4ee4\u724c\u8f6e\u6362**\uff1a\u811a\u672c\u548c\u6837\u5f0f\u6807\u7b7e\u4e2d\u7684 CSP Nonce \u503c\u5df2\u66f4\u65b0\uff0c\u8fd9\u901a\u5e38\u662f\u81ea\u52a8\u6784\u5efa\u8fc7\u7a0b\u751f\u6210\u7684\u3002\n        *   **\u96f6\u5185\u5bb9\u53d8\u66f4**\uff1a\u5173\u4e8e\u63d0\u793a\u8bcd\u5de5\u7a0b\u7684\u5b9e\u9645\u6307\u5bfc\u6587\u672c\u672a\u53d1\u751f\u4efb\u4f55\u6539\u53d8\u3002\n    *   *Impact:* **\u4f4e**\u3002\u7531\u4e8e\u6587\u6863\u7684\u5b9e\u9645\u5185\u5bb9\uff08\u5373\u5f00\u53d1\u8005\u9605\u8bfb\u7684\u6307\u5bfc\u5efa\u8bae\uff09\u672a\u53d1\u751f\u6539\u53d8\uff0c\u8fd9\u4e0d\u4f1a\u5f71\u54cd\u5f00\u53d1\u8005\u7684\u77e5\u8bc6\u5e93\u6216\u7f16\u7801\u5b9e\u8df5\u3002\n    *   *Action Items:*\n        *   **\u65e0\u9700\u5173\u6ce8**\uff1a\u5f00\u53d1\u8005\u4e0d\u9700\u8981\u91cd\u65b0\u9605\u8bfb\u6587\u6863\u6216\u66f4\u65b0\u4ee3\u7801\u3002\n        *   **\u786e\u8ba4\u90e8\u7f72**\uff1a\u4ec5\u9700\u786e\u8ba4\u8fd9\u662f\u5426\u4e3a\u8ba1\u5212\u7684\u7ad9\u70b9\u91cd\u5efa\u6216\u90e8\u7f72\u6d3b\u52a8\u3002\n        *   **\u65e0\u64cd\u4f5c**\uff1a\u65e0\u9700\u91c7\u53d6\u4efb\u4f55\u6280\u672f\u884c\u52a8\u3002\n\n5.  **Final Review against Constraints:**\n    *   Markdown format?
