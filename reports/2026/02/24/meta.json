Let me look closer.\n            *   Actually, looking at the diffs provided in the prompt:\n                *   Diff 1 (be-clear-and-direct): Starts with `<!DOCTYPE html>...`. Changes are purely the HTML boilerplate (scripts/styles). The content part is missing or not shown in the diff snippet because the line count change is small (+3/-3) but the HTML head is huge. It's likely the *actual* content change is hidden or these are just build artifacts being compared.\n                *   *Wait, let's re-read the diff format.*\n                *   The diff shows `@@ -1,4 +1,4 @@`. This means only the first 4 lines changed.\n                *   The content is literally `<html>...` and the `nonce` values or script hashes are changing.\n                *   *Crucial Observation:* There are **zero** changes to the actual markdown text content visible in these diffs. The diffs are strictly showing changes to the *generated HTML output* or build artifacts (specifically CSP nonces or hashes).\n        *   *Hypothesis:* The input is likely a diff of the *built* static HTML files, not the source Markdown. The changes (+3/-3) are superficial changes to the build artifacts (like CSP nonces, script chunks, or hash changes due to a rebuild), not actual documentation content updates.\n\n3.  **Evaluate the Significance (Impact Level):**\n    *   Since the changes are only in the HTML/CSS/JS build artifacts (nonces, hashes) and not in the textual content of the documentation itself:\n    *   **Impact Level:** **Low**.\n    *   **Reasoning:** These are non-functional changes related to the site's build process (e.g., Content Security Policy nonces, cache busting, or a minor rebuild). The documentation content for developers (prompts, tips, engineering guides) remains unchanged based on the provided diffs.\n\n4.  **Draft the Analysis (in Chinese):**\n\n    *   **Overall Summary:** \u672c\u6b21\u53d8\u66f4\u6d89\u53ca `build-with-claude/prompt-engineering` \u4e0b\u7684 8 \u4e2a\u9875\u9762\u3002\u6240\u6709\u53d8\u66f4\u5747\u4e3a\u6784\u5efa\u4ea7\u7269\u5c42\u9762\u7684\u4fee\u6539\uff08\u5982 HTML \u5934\u90e8\u3001\u811a\u672c\u5f15\u7528\uff09\uff0c\u6587\u6863\u7684\u5b9e\u9645\u5185\u5bb9\u6ca1\u6709\u53d1\u751f\u4efb\u4f55\u53d8\u5316\u3002\n    *   **Key Themes:**\n        *   \u6784\u5efa\u5de5\u4ef6\u66f4\u65b0\n        *   CSP Nonce \u53d8\u5316\n        *   Next.js \u9759\u6001\u8d44\u6e90\u54c8\u5e0c\u53d8\u66f4\n        *   \u5185\u5bb9\u65e0\u53d8\u5316\n    *   **Impact Level:** Low.

"reasoning": "1.  **Understand the Goal:** The user wants a concise, insightful analysis of a batch of documentation changes. The output must be in Chinese, following a specific markdown format (Overall Summary, Key Themes, Impact Level, Action Items).\n\n2.  **Analyze the Input Data:**\n    *   **Total Changed Pages:** 9.\n    *   **Pages 1-8:** These are all `.md` files located under `build-with-claude/prompt-engineering/`.\n        *   `be-clear-and-direct.md`\n        *   `multishot-prompting.md`\n        *   `chain-of-thought.md`\n        *   `use-xml-tags.md`\n        *   `system-prompts.md`\n        *   `chain-prompts.md`\n        *   `long-context-tips.md`\n        *   `extended-thinking-tips.md`\n    *   **Diff Content for Pages 1-8:** The diffs provided show changes *only* in the first line of HTML structure. Specifically, the changes involve the `nonce` attribute values within the `<head>` tags.\n        *   Example: `nonce=\"n9cl1flKr1N2hiy10zSarw==\"` changed to something else (though the diff shows `--- a/...` and `+++ b/...`, the actual change line isn't explicitly visible in the snippet provided other than the header and the first line cut off).\n        *   Wait, looking closely at the provided diffs for Pages 1-8: They all show `+3 / -3`. The content visible is just the start of the HTML `<!DOCTYPE html...` line. It looks like the `nonce` attribute changed or a hash changed in the link/script tags. This is typical of a static site generator rebuild (Next.js) where asset hashes or nonces change on every build.\n        *   *Crucially*: There is *no* actual text content change in the documentation text itself shown in the diffs. It's all HTML boilerplate hashes.\n    *   **Page 9:** `CHANGELOG.md.md` (Note: double extension `.md.md` looks like a typo in the source or just the filename provided).\n        *   Diff Content: Added a new entry for version `2.1.52`.\n        *   Change: \"VS Code: Fixed extension crash on Windows ('command 'claude-vscode.editor.openLast' not found')\".\n\n3.  **Synthesize the Findings:**\n    *   **Documentation Content (Pages 1-8):** No actual content changes. The diffs are purely build artifacts (HTML hashes/nonces). This suggests a redeployment of the site without content modifications.\n    *   **Product Release (Page 9):** Version `2.1.52` of the VS Code extension was released. It fixes a specific crash issue on Windows related to a missing command.\n\n4.  **Drafting the Analysis (in Chinese):**\n\n    *   **Overall Summary:** Most changes are just HTML build artifacts (nonces/hashes). The actual substance is a new VS Code extension version (2.1.52) fixing a Windows crash bug.\n        *   *Draft (CN):* \u6b64\u6b21\u66f4\u65b0\u4e3b\u8981\u5305\u542b VS Code \u6269\u5c55\u7684\u65b0\u7248\u672c\u53d1\u5e03\uff0c\u4fee\u590d\u4e86 Windows \u5e73\u53f0\u4e0a\u7684\u5d29\u6e83\u95ee\u9898\u3002\u5176\u4f59 8 \u4e2a\u9875\u9762\u4ec5\u5305\u542b\u6784\u5efa\u4ea7\u751f\u7684 HTML \u54c8\u5e0c\u53d8\u66f4\uff0c\u65e0\u5b9e\u8d28\u6027\u5185\u5bb9\u4fee\u6539\u3002\n\n    *   **Key Themes:**\n        *   Artifact regeneration/Rebuild.\n        *   Bug fix (VS Code extension on Windows).\n        *   *Draft (CN):*\n            *   \u6784\u5efa\u4ea7\u7269\u66f4\u65b0\uff1a\u5927\u90e8\u5206\u53d8\u66f4\u4ec5\u6d89\u53ca Next.js \u6784\u5efa\u8fc7\u7a0b\u4e2d\u7684 HTML nonce \u548c\u8d44\u6e90\u54c8\u5e0c\u503c\uff0c\u5c5e\u4e8e\u65e0\u5185\u5bb9\u7684\u91cd\u5efa\u3002\n            *   Bug \u4fee\u590d\uff1aVS Code \u6269\u8865\u4e01\u4fee\u590d\u4e86\u7279\u5b9a\u9519\u8bef\u547d\u4ee4\u5bfc\u81f4\u7684 Windows \u5d29\u6e83\u95ee\u9898\u3002\n\n    *   **Impact Level:**\n        *   Reasoning: The fix is for a crash.
