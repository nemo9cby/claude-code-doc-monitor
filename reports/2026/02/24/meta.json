Let me look closer.\n            *   Actually, looking at the diffs provided in the prompt:\n                *   Diff 1 (be-clear-and-direct): Starts with `<!DOCTYPE html>...`. Changes are purely the HTML boilerplate (scripts/styles). The content part is missing or not shown in the diff snippet because the line count change is small (+3/-3) but the HTML head is huge. It's likely the *actual* content change is hidden or these are just build artifacts being compared.\n                *   *Wait, let's re-read the diff format.*\n                *   The diff shows `@@ -1,4 +1,4 @@`. This means only the first 4 lines changed.\n                *   The content is literally `<html>...` and the `nonce` values or script hashes are changing.\n                *   *Crucial Observation:* There are **zero** changes to the actual markdown text content visible in these diffs. The diffs are strictly showing changes to the *generated HTML output* or build artifacts (specifically CSP nonces or hashes).\n        *   *Hypothesis:* The input is likely a diff of the *built* static HTML files, not the source Markdown. The changes (+3/-3) are superficial changes to the build artifacts (like CSP nonces, script chunks, or hash changes due to a rebuild), not actual documentation content updates.\n\n3.  **Evaluate the Significance (Impact Level):**\n    *   Since the changes are only in the HTML/CSS/JS build artifacts (nonces, hashes) and not in the textual content of the documentation itself:\n    *   **Impact Level:** **Low**.\n    *   **Reasoning:** These are non-functional changes related to the site's build process (e.g., Content Security Policy nonces, cache busting, or a minor rebuild). The documentation content for developers (prompts, tips, engineering guides) remains unchanged based on the provided diffs.\n\n4.  **Draft the Analysis (in Chinese):**\n\n    *   **Overall Summary:** \u672c\u6b21\u53d8\u66f4\u6d89\u53ca `build-with-claude/prompt-engineering` \u4e0b\u7684 8 \u4e2a\u9875\u9762\u3002\u6240\u6709\u53d8\u66f4\u5747\u4e3a\u6784\u5efa\u4ea7\u7269\u5c42\u9762\u7684\u4fee\u6539\uff08\u5982 HTML \u5934\u90e8\u3001\u811a\u672c\u5f15\u7528\uff09\uff0c\u6587\u6863\u7684\u5b9e\u9645\u5185\u5bb9\u6ca1\u6709\u53d1\u751f\u4efb\u4f55\u53d8\u5316\u3002\n    *   **Key Themes:**\n        *   \u6784\u5efa\u5de5\u4ef6\u66f4\u65b0\n        *   CSP Nonce \u53d8\u5316\n        *   Next.js \u9759\u6001\u8d44\u6e90\u54c8\u5e0c\u53d8\u66f4\n        *   \u5185\u5bb9\u65e0\u53d8\u5316\n    *   **Impact Level:** Low.
