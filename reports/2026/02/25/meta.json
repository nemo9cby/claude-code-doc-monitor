 **Role:** World-class programmer analyzing documentation changes.\n    *   **Input:** A batch of 8 changed pages, all under `build-with-claude/prompt-engineering/`.\n    *   **Format:** Markdown, concise, insightful analysis.\n    *   **Language:** Chinese (requested in the prompt: \"\u8bf7\u7528\u4e2d\u6587\u56de\u590d\").\n    *   **Focus:** What matters to developers.\n    *   **Specific Sections:** 1. Overall Summary, 2. Key Themes, 3. Impact Level (with reasoning), 4. Action Items.\n\n2.  **Analyze the Input Data (The Diffs):**\n    *   I see 8 diffs.\n    *   All filenames end in `.md` but the content shown is raw HTML source code (`<!DOCTYPE html><html ...`).\n    *   The diff format is `@@ -1,4 +1,4 @@`.\n    *   Looking closely at the *content* of the diff:\n        *   Old line: A massive HTML string starting with `<!DOCTYPE html...`. The CSS/JS links have specific `nonce` values (e.g., `LEmXX/GMaT2vuiR99NTTbA==`).\n        *   New line: A massive HTML string starting with `<!DOCTYPE html...`. The structure looks identical, *except* the `nonce` values have changed.\n        *   Example 1 (`be-clear-and-direct.md`): `nonce=\"LEmXX/GMaT2vuiR99NTTbA==\"` changed to something... wait, let me look closer.\n        *   Actually, looking at the raw diff provided, the *new* version line is cut off at the very end in some cases (e.g., `<` at the end instead of `</script>` or `</html>`), but visually, the only visible changes in the beginning/middle are the `nonce` attributes on the `<link>` and `<script>` tags.\n        *   `nonce` stands for \"number used once\". It's a security feature for Content Security Policy (CSP) to inline scripts/styles.\n        *   Crucially: The text content *within* the HTML (the actual documentation text like \"Be Clear and Direct\" or \"Multishot Prompting\") is NOT visible in these diffs. The diffs only show the HTML boilerplate headers.\n        *   Wait, let me re-read the diff carefully.\n            *   `--- a/...`\n            *   `+++ b/...`\n            *   The line shows the entire HTML blob on one line (wrapped in the display).\n            *   The key observation is that the `nonce` values change on *every* build for static site generators that use CSPs.\n            *   However, strictly speaking, if the input is *just* the HTML source diff, I can't see the *actual* content changes to the markdown documentation itself.\n            *   BUT, usually, when a system provides diffs like this, it might be a scraping artifact or the user provided the HTML source of the rendered page instead of the Markdown source.\n            *   *Self-Correction/Refinement:* If the prompt is asking me to analyze \"documentation changes\" and the *only* difference I can see is the HTML header `nonce` values changing, then the actual *content* of the documentation hasn't changed, or at least, I can't verify it from this HTML-only diff.\n            *   *Alternative Interpretation:* Is it possible the user *thinks* these are the diffs, but actually, the *files themselves* are `.md` files containing HTML? No, the path ends in `.md`. If it were a Jekyll/Next.js system, maybe they are dumping the rendered HTML into the repo? Unlikely.\n            *   *Most likely scenario:* This is a static site build artifact change. The `nonce` values are regenerated on every build. The actual documentation *content* (text) is not shown in these diffs because the diff is comparing the entire HTML structure which is mostly identical except for the nonces.\n            *   *However*, looking at the file names: `be-clear-and-direct.md`, `multishot-prompting.md`, etc. These are \"Prompt Engineering\" guides.\n            *   If the diff *only* shows `nonce` changes, the actual *textual content* hasn't changed in the part I can see.\n            *   Is there any other change? The line lengths are slightly different at the end (some are truncated). But mostly, it's just the `nonce` strings.\n            *   *Conclusion on Content:* There is **no detectable content change** in the provided text diffs regarding the actual documentation text (tutorials, guides, examples). The changes are purely technical build artifacts (CSP nonces).\n\n3.  **Drafting the Analysis (Internal Monologue):**\n    *   *Summary:* The diffs show 8 pages in the Prompt Engineering section. The only visible changes are updates to the cryptographic `nonce` values in the HTML headers. This suggests a technical rebuild or redeploy rather than a content update.\n    *   *Key Themes:* Build artifacts, CSP Nonces, No content changes detected.\n    *   *Impact Level:* Low/None (for developers reading the docs). Technical infrastructure change only.\n    *   *Action Items:* None. This is noise from a build system.\n\n4.  **Refining for \"What matters to developers\":**\n    *   Developers care if the API changed, if the prompt examples changed, or if best practices updated.\n    *   Since I can't see any text changes (just HTML boilerplate), I must inform the user that **no content changes are detectable** in these diffs. It's likely a false positive in change detection due to dynamic `nonce` generation in the build pipeline.\n\n5.  **Translating to Chinese (as requested):**\n\n    *   *Overall Summary:* \u6b64\u6b21\u63d0\u4ea4\u6d89\u53ca 8 \u4e2a\u63d0\u793a\u8bcd\u5de5\u7a0b\u76f8\u5173\u9875\u9762\u3002Diff \u4ec5\u663e\u793a\u4e86 HTML \u6e90\u7801\u4e2d CSP Nonce \u503c\u7684\u66f4\u65b0\uff0c\u672a\u53d1\u73b0\u5b9e\u9645\u6587\u6863\u5185\u5bb9\u7684\u53d8\u66f4\u3002\u8fd9\u901a\u5e38\u662f\u6784\u5efa\u7cfb\u7edf\u91cd\u65b0\u751f\u6210\u7684\u4ea7\u7269\uff0c\u800c\u975e\u5185\u5bb9\u5c42\u9762\u7684\u4fee\u6539\u3002\n\n    *   *Key Themes:*\n        *   **\u6784\u5efa\u4ea7\u7269\u53d8\u52a8:** \u4ec5 HTML \u5934\u90e8\u7684 CSP `nonce` \u503c\u53d1\u751f\u53d8\u5316\u3002\n        *   **\u65e0\u5185\u5bb9\u66f4\u65b0:** \u6587\u6863\u6b63\u6587\u3001\u793a\u4f8b\u4ee3\u7801\u6216\u8bf4\u660e\u5747\u672a\u5728 Diff \u4e2d\u4f53\u73b0\u3002\n        *   **\u57fa\u7840\u8bbe\u65bd/\u90e8\u7f72:** \u7591\u4f3c\u7531\u81ea\u52a8\u6784\u5efa\u6216\u91cd\u65b0\u90e8\u7f72\u89e6\u53d1\u3002\n\n    *   *Impact Level:*\n        *   **\u7ea7\u522b:** \u65e0 / \u6781\u4f4e\n        *   **\u7406\u7531:** \u53d8\u66f4\u4ec5\u6d89\u53ca HTML \u5b89\u5168\u54c8\u5e0c\u503c\uff0c\u4e0d\u5f71\u54cd\u6587\u6863\u53ef\u8bfb\u6027\u3001API \u884c\u4e3a\u6216\u5f00\u53d1\u6307\u5357\u3002\u5f00\u53d1\u8005\u65e0\u9700\u8c03\u6574\u4ee3\u7801\u6216\u5b66\u4e60\u65b0\u77e5\u8bc6\u3002\n\n    *   *Action Items:*\n        *   \u65e0\u9700\u91c7\u53d6\u884c\u52a8\u3002\n        *   \u53ef\u5ffd\u7565\u6b64\u6b21\u53d8\u66f4\u3002\n        *   \u5efa\u8bae\u68c0\u67e5\u6784\u5efa\u914d\u7f6e\uff0c\u6392\u9664 `.html` \u6216\u4ec5\u5173\u6ce8 Markdown \u6e90\u6587\u4ef6\u4ee5\u51cf\u5c11\u6b64\u7c7b\u566a\u97f3\u3002\n\n6.  **Final Review:**\n    *   Does it meet the markdown format?
